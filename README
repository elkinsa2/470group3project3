# Instructions for running conf-monit
    1. download compressed file from https://github.com/lmstock/470group3project3.git or Canvas
    2. extract with tar xjf a3.tar.bz3
    3. chmod 744 conf-monit
    4. run ./conf-monit 10.2.x.x (using the ipv4 address of the machine receiving the configuration)
    
# Instructions for running test script

# Informational

- this solution provides notifications to email 
- (set additional email addresses to line 154 of /etc/monitrc), syslog, and the Monit Service Manager console at 10.2.7.72:2812.       
- The SERVER VM monitors itself using the following checks:

- SYSTEM 
  - Alert to load average greater than 3 for 4 cycles for 5 minutes.
  - Alert to load average greater than 1 for 4 cycles for 15 minutes.
  - Alert to memory usage greater than 80% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to swap usage greater than 20% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to cpu user usage greater than 80% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to cpu system usage greater than 20% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to cpu wait time greater than 20% for 4 cycles.
  
- PROCESSES
  - Alert to syslog process down for 30 seconds and will attempt to restart service.
  - Alert to ssh process down or failed port 22 for 30 seconds and will attempt to restart service.
  - Alert to httpd process down or failed port 80 for 30 seconds and will attempt to restart service.
  - Alert to nfs process down or failed port 2049 for 30 seconds and will attempt to restart service.
  - Alert to slapd (ldap) process down or failed port 389 for 30 seconds and will attempt to restart service.
  
- FILESYSTEM
  - Alert to filesystem /root at /dev/sda1 greater than 80% capacity.
  - Alert to filesystem /var at /dev/sda2 greater than 80% capacity.
  - Alert to filesystem /home at /dev/sda4 greater than 80% capacity.
  
-The SERVER VM monitors CLIENTS using the following checks:
        
- CLIENTS
  - Alert to failed ICMP pings to configured clients. (Additional clients can be configured after line 369 at /etc/monitrc) 
 
 
- Any CLIENT VMs configured with the conf-monit script will monitor itself using the following checks:
  
- SYSTEM 
  - Alert to load average greater than 3 for 4 cycles for 5 minutes.
  - Alert to load average greater than 1 for 4 cycles for 15 minutes.
  - Alert to memory usage greater than 80% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to swap usage greater than 20% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to cpu user usage greater than 80% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to cpu system usage greater than 20% for 4 cycles.
  - Alert to cpu wait time greater than 20% for 4 cycles.
         
- PROCESSES
  - Alert to syslog process down for 30 seconds and will attempt to restart service.
  - Alert to ssh process down or failed port 22 for 30 seconds and will attempt to restart service.
         
- FILESYSTEM
  - Alert to filesystem /root at /dev/sda1 greater than 80% capacity.
  - Alert to filesystem /var at /dev/sda2 greater than 80% capacity.
     
- SERVER SERVICES
  - The CLIENT VMs will monitor the SERVER services for syslog, ldap, and nfs 
    through TCP pings to thier respective common port numbers and alert if failed.
